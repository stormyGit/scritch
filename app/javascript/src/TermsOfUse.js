          Scritch’s terms and conditions of use (“Terms of Use”) that apply to
          the Scritch services included currently in the Scritch website (the
          “Site”) and the future Scritch mobile application (collectively, the
          “Services”). The Services are owned and operated by Scritch Limited.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE
          SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Welcome to Scritch! The Services provide our users with online tools
          designed to facilitate and share our love of fursuit media to foster
          closeness in the furry community. These Terms of Use protect the legal
          interests of Scritch Limited, our users, and any future third party
          vendors.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Your use of the Services and your purchase of Products is expressly
          conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use. If you do not
          consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any
          Services. If you access the Services on behalf of a company or other
          entity, you warrant that you are an authorised representative of such
          company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to
          these Terms of Use.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you
          and Scritch Limited have against each other are resolved (see{" "}
          <a href="#dispute_resolution" className={classes.link}>
            Dispute Resolution Section

          ). These Terms of Use also contain provisions requiring you to resolve
          certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by
          binding arbitration, rather than in court. If you do not consent to
          such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Scritch Limited reserves the right to change, modify, revise or
          otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other
          terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at
          any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of
          Use have been modified. Such notice may be provided by sending an
          email, or by posting a notice on the Site (or associated channels), or
          by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date
          at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as
          determined by Scritch Limited. Your continued use of the Services, or
          your purchase of any Products or the Services following the posting of
          the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your
          acceptance of such changes or modifications. Otherwise, any changes or
          modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting
          of the revisions on the Site unless you notify Scritch Limited within
          such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop
          using the Services. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use
          whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days
          to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will
          apply to your use of the Services.

          PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU
          TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH SCRITCH LIMITED AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN
          WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS
          SECTION, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          You and Scritch Limited agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from
          these Terms of Use or relating to the Services, Site or Scritch
          Materials. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING
          A JURY TRIAL. You and Scritch Limited agree:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          to notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it
          arises;
          <br/>
          to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration;
          <br/>
          that any arbitration will occur in the United Kingdom; and;
          <br/>
          that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single
          arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the Advisory, Conciliation
          and Arbitration Service (“ACAS”), including the ACAS’s Supplementary
          Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The ACAS’s rules are available at www.acas.org.uk. Other than class
          procedures and remedies described in these Terms of Use, the
          arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise
          be available in court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Scritch
          Limited are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either
          party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of
          copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations
          involving different Scritch Limited or Scritch users but is bound by
          rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Scritch Limited or
          Scritch user to the extent required by applicable law. The
          arbitrator’s award will be final and binding and judgment on the award
          rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
          jurisdiction thereof. YOU AND SCRITCH LIMITED AGREE THAT EACH MAY
          BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS
          PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
          UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SCRITCH LIMITED AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR
          MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS
          AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED,
          REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD
          RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY
          IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT
          NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL
          CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER SCRITCH LIMITED OR
          SCRITCH USERS.

          Unless you and Scritch Limited agree otherwise, in the event that a
          court decides that any part of this Section is invalid or
          unenforceable, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or
          may arise between you and Scritch Limited must be resolved exclusively
          by a court located in the United Kingdom. The remainder of the Terms
          of Use will continue to apply. You and Scritch Limited agree to submit
          to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the United
          Kingdom for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
